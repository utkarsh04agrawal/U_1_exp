1. Make scrambling all-to-all and scrambling.
2. Probably the bottleneck for Qiskit simulations is the transpiling step. Should save the transpiled circuit.

Above tasks Done!
Submitting noisy scrambling data on cluster
1. The noisy data has been collected. The new code is much faster as the scrambling step is decomposed from the start and the transpiler has to work less. To run SEP on it.
2. Get unitary gates to run quantum decoder and biased decoder.
3. Forgot to save the scrambling_parameter. Should figure out an efficeint way to do so.
